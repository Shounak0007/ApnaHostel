<div style="font-size:x-large "><li>The main pro about this hostel, is for the students enrolled in PICT. Just few steps away from the institute. It has its own Mess facility. The amenities are good. Room shared between two people, with a cot, a chair and a table also provided. Easily reachable by public transport too! (Bus no. 215, though from swargate) Mess food is good.</li></div><hr>
